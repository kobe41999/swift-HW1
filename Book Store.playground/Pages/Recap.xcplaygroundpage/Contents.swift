 # Recap
 
 This playground contains an example of book store which is made by
 using closures and APIs of collections in Swift.
 
 Try to open the **Navigator** of Xcode, and open the "Sources" folder.
 Check `BookStore+from.swift`.
 
 There's a function at line 4:
 `public static func from(_ books: [[String: String]]) -> BookStore`.
 Try to read and understand those lines of code. You're welcome to discuss them.
